Damn this game is easy. First try skips on F52, F59, and F62 would have saved me an entire minute and 30 seconds. I think my end goal for this game is sub 31. I&#39;ve got a strong urge to improve this run.","chapters":[{"id":"","startMilliseconds":0,"lengthMilliseconds":2150000,"type":"GAME_CHANGE","description":"Unknown","subDescription":"","thumbnailUrl":null,"gameId":"-1","gameDisplayName":"Unknown","gameBoxArtUrl":""}],"streamer":{"name":"GeoGeo222","login":"geogeo222","id":40531267}},"embedded_data":{"twitch_badges":{}},"messages":[]}
